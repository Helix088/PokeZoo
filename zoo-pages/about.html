      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p>
        We are a nonprofit organization. The PokéZoo is home to the world's
        first online Pokémon Zoo where you can view over a 1000 species of
        Pokémon from the comfort of your own home! We have done this for the
        enjoyment of all and to help foster in a new age of zoos that do not
        hold any animals (and Pokémon) in captivity. We believe animals (and
        Pokémon) should remain where they are in their own environments to live
        long and happy lives. We love animals (and Pokémon) and are advocates for
        them in anyway that we can be.
      </p>
      <h3>What do we do?</h3>
      <p>
        We are in the field of education and adventure and we do this by helping
        people become aware of their local and global environment. We help by
        taking in donation from generous donors and give all of that money to
        animals conservation agencies. We accomplish this goal by creating this
        new virtual zoo to help show people that they can enjoy the same aspects
        of the zoo, and not have to goal to a physical zoo. We work with animal
        conservation agencies to provide valuable information to help raise
        awareness that animals are in need of our help.

              ><strong>Pokédex Entry:</strong> My name is Chase Patterson, I am
              a BYU-Idaho student, from Louisiana, I have been in web
              development for three years. I have built multiple responsive
              websites, mobile apps and components, games, and programs. I enjoy
              spending time with my wife and family, but I also love video
              games. I play sports such as football, basketball, softball,
              baseball, and track/field. I enjoy getting to create websites such
              as this one and sharing it with others. The most enjoyable thing
              to me about web development and programming is seeing the end
              result and having people enjoy the sites and programs.</em
